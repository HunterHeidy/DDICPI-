DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d328.s19.p0	Even so @DRUG$ plasma concentrations in the presence of high doses of @DRUG$ were almost 5-fold lower than those seen in CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary.	DDI-mechanism

DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d249.s2.p7	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all NSAIDs, including @DRUG$, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.

DDI-DrugBank.d246.s14.p0	Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with, or immediately following, a @DRUG$.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d459.s2.p0	The concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.	DDI-effect
DDI-MedLine.d12.s7.p4	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d477.s3.p0	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d48.s1.p10	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d277.s13.p14	Valproate: The addition of tiagabine to patients taking valproate chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics, but @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ binding in vitro from 96.3 to 94.8%, which resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in the free tiagabine concentration.	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d314.s3.p2	Antibiotics: @DRUG$ have been reported to cause a significant decrease in @DRUG$ clearance.	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d32.s7.p1	however, 150 mg of @DRUG$ q12h for 3 days increased the ceftibuten C max by 23% and @DRUG$ AUC by 16%.	DDI-mechanism

DDI-DrugBank.d94.s13.p6	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d566.s0.p9	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, @DRUG$ and progestins, and digitalis.	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d463.s0.p0	It is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution.	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d495.s4.p0	@DRUG$ may antagonize the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d470.s1.p2	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as @DRUG$ or amphotericin B).	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d328.s20.p3	Lithium: @DRUG$ 40 mg BID for 7 days produced significant decreases in @DRUG$ serum clearance (25%) and renal clearance (30%) with a 34% higher serum exposure compared to lithium alone.	DDI-mechanism

DDI-DrugBank.d107.s1.p4	The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril or @DRUG$ can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril or enalaprilat.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d297.s4.p0	Concurrent therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d552.s0.p1	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or @DRUG$, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).	DDI-advise
DDI-MedLine.d29.s8.p0	This might be explained by a blockade by @DRUG$ of the elimination of @DRUG$ by the liver.	DDI-mechanism

DDI-DrugBank.d228.s2.p2	Reciprocal interactions may occur with concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, ketoconazole), though this has not been studied	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d506.s9.p5	Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, @DRUG$ should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after @DRUG$ administration.	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d528.s0.p7	Acetaminophen and methotrexate - @DRUG$ may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with @DRUG$ overdosage or in those taking methotrexate.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d82.s14.p0	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d508.s1.p13	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$ and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.	DDI-effect

DDI-DrugBank.d231.s5.p0	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce lithiums renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d434.s31.p12	Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of Felbatol  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d401.s0.p14	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.

DDI-DrugBank.d502.s1.p0	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d423.s0.p4	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.	DDI-effect

DDI-DrugBank.d48.s15.p62	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

DDI-DrugBank.d386.s23.p2	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or @DRUG$/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d249.s5.p4	Patients who begin taking @DRUG$ or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other NSAID while taking digoxin, methotrexate, or @DRUG$ may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.	DDI-effect
