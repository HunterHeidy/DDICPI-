DDI-DrugBank.d602.s1.p0	Concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ resulted in a 21% increase in the AUC of @DRUG$.	DDI-mechanism
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s10.p5	The sedative effect of @DRUG$ is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly narcotics (eg, morphine, meperidine and fentanyl), propofol, @DRUG$, nitrous oxide, secobarbital and droperidol.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s6.p4	Given the primary CNS effects of paliperidone, @DRUG$    should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d726.s1.p62	A multiple dose drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that ketoconazole approximately doubled paricalcitol AUC0-   . Since paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A and ketoconazole le is known to be a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme, care should be taken while dosing @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong P450 3A inhibitors including atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin or voriconazole.	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d587.s0.p5	Since Celontin (@DRUG$) may interact with concurrently administered @DRUG$, periodic serum level determinations of these drugs may be necessary (eg methsuximide may increase the plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenobarbital).	DDI-advise
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s0.p5	Diuretics: Furosemide and probably other @DRUG$ given concomitantly with @DRUG$ can cause unusually large or prolonged losses of fluid and electrolytes.	DDI-effect
DDI-DrugBank.d623.s1.p0	@DRUG$ administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ may significantly decrease the serum concentrations of MPA.	DDI-mechanism
DDI-MedLine.d231.s8.p6	Moxifloxacin and @DRUG$ reacts faster with sucralfate and @DRUG$ in acidic media whereas with erythromycin in basic media and multi-minerals in neutral media.	DDI-mechanism
