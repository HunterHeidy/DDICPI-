28409271	Metabolic cutis laxa results from Menkes syndrome, caused by a defect in the ATPase copper transporting alpha (ATP7A) gene; congenital disorders of glycosylation due to mutations in subunit 7 of the component of oligomeric Golgi (COG7)-congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) complex; combined disorder of N- and O-linked glycosylation, due to mutations in ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a2 (ATP6VOA2) gene; pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 deficiency; pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase deficiency; macrocephaly, alopecia, cutis laxa, and scoliosis (MACS) syndrome, due to Ras and Rab interactor 2 (RIN2) mutations; transaldolase deficiency caused by mutations in the transaldolase 1 (TALDO1) gene; Gerodermia osteodysplastica due to mutations in the golgin, RAB6-interacting (GORAB or SCYL1BP1) gene; and mitogen-activated pathway (MAP) kinase defects, caused by mutations in several genes [protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor-type 11 (PTPN11), RAF, NF, HRas proto-oncogene, GTPase (HRAS), B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), MEK1/2, KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS), SOS Ras/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (SOS2), leucine rich repeat scaffold protein (SHOC2), NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS), and Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (RAF1)], which regulate the Ras-MAPK cascade.	RAF1	scoliosis	TRUE
29891662	Our findings indicate that BM-derived MSCs from patients with newly diagnosed AML display phenotypic and functional alterations such as proliferative deficiency that could be attributed to tumor progression, but does not seem to play a special role in the leukemic process	MSC	tumor	FALSE
27799525	The tumor cells resembled pro-B cells, and were CD19+IgM-IgD-CD93+CD43+CD21-CD23-VpreB+CXCR4+ Consistent with the pro-B-cell stage of B-cell development, microarray analysis revealed enrichment of transcripts, including Rag1, Rag2, CD93, Vpreb1, Vpreb3, and Igll1 We confirmed RAG1 expression in Tg26 tumors, and hypothesized that HIV-1 matrix protein p17 may directly induce RAG1 in B cells.	Rag1	tumor	TRUE
29857855	Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous RMND1 variants in a 4-year-old patient with congenital lactic acidosis, severe myopathy, hearing loss, renal failure, and dysautonomia.	RMND1	hearing loss	TRUE
29762727	In lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), specific thyroxin kinase inhibitors against EGFR mutations and ALK fusions are used as a standard treatment regimen and show significant positive efficacy.	EGFR	lung adenocarcinoma	FALSE
29272308	However, the global effects of DIO1 expression in various tissues affected by cancer remain unknown.	DIO1	cancer	FALSE
29920276	Serendipitously, we found that overexpression of Twist1 in mouse muscle progenitor cells, either constitutively during development or inducibly in adult animals, caused severe muscle atrophy with features reminiscent of cachexia.	Twist1	cachexia	FALSE
29119105	Mutations in genes involved in the biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor cause autosomal recessive glycosylation defects, with a wide phenotypic spectrum of intellectual disability, seizures, minor facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase.	GPI	autosomal recessive	FALSE
